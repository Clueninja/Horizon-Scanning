# Horizon-Scanning
Horizon Scanning is the practice of continually searching and collating news, articles and press releases to monitor the external trends behind technology development.â€¯ The goal of horizon scanning, is not to try to accurately predict the future, but to identify, compile, and analyse the various signals of change.
